# Rice Leaf Disease Detection
### The sample file contains 119 images of rice leaves with 3 types of diseases like - Bacterial leaf blight of rice, Brown spot, Leaf smut.
### Each class of images contains arouf 39-40 images each for precise training of model.
### Python libraries used - Seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, numpy, tensorflow.
### The model gave the accuracy of 83% using activation function as Relu - therefore, performed data augmentation to improve the accuracy.
### Tried with different optimizers to check with the accuracy, finalised with the ADAM optimizer as it gives the highest accuracy of 87.50 compared to all the other optimizers.
### For checking the model performance, 100 samples were tested and the all the 100 samples were predicted accurately.
### Tried different ways for prediction like - by uploading the image from PC, by passing the URL of the image from internet.
